Misc. additions for my customized game run

Notes:
1. This is based on WW-Blueprint-Core (https://github.com/WittleWolfie/WW-Blueprint-Core) but I am developing on Debian so I had to make some changes to the template. 

2. This is my first attempt at a Mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. It’s probably poorly done and has a high likelihood of breaking your game if you implement this as is.

3. It’s not done (Alpha stage).

What I am going for…

New Class: Arcane Skirmisher. This is a combination of Eldritch Archer and Arcane Rider with a number of removed features and restriction to keep it from being unbalanced. The class fantasy is that of a magic enhanced horse archer (something like a variation of Nomad or Sohei). Designed for Arueshalae. (Status: mostly done, in play testing).

New Class: Life Senate. An attempt to make a viable healer from a Kineticist. Something of an Anti-Dark Elementalist. Incorporates something similar to “Internal Buffer” from Pathfinder 2e. At least right now it can accept burn, but all of the burn related benefits have been removed. Offensive capability has been nerfed as well to compensate for the burn pool and expanded healing capability. Several Wild Talents removed as well. The class fantasy is a Naturalist or Researcher who taps into a unknown source of power discovered in the Wilds and goes feral. I was aiming for something like an Int based Druid. When I am done I hope to have a viable healer that gets to play around with blasts and infusions when not healing. Designed with Nenio in mind. (Status: Half done. Burn pool, Empowered Healing complete. I am playing around with adding a Metakinesis: Selective that would apply only to Healing Burst and a few other optional feats).

Modified Class: Keen-eyed Adventurer. A cantrip focused class sounds great, but Owlcat’s implementation is boring. This is an attempt to make this a bit more valid of a choice. Added a lesser version of Cantrip Mastery at level 1 to make cantrips a viable “weapon” choice in the beginning of the game (gets rid of weird useless crossbows). Also gets a pet at level 4, giving at least some small reason to continue the class past 10 instead of defaulting to Winter Witch. What decent adventurer doesn’t at some point adopt a pet? (Status: done, play testing to make sure new ‘Cantrip Specialization’ isn’t too strong in the early game).

Modified Item: Triceratops Statue. Changing the *spoiler* ‘Bismuth’ Statue to a 1 time use item that grants the Animal Companion (Triceratops) feat and Druid -3 companion progression. The result will be just as if the class you are playing had an animal companion in its progression. The item won’t be usable by archetypes that already have an animal companion selected. It will be up to the player if they choose to name the companion ‘Bismuth’ (though they are terrible people if they don’t). (Status: Just Started)
